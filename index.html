            Hello! My name is <strong>Manos Pepanidis</strong>, and I am a student at <strong>Northeastern University</strong> studying <strong>Computer Science & Fintech</strong>.
            I have a strong interest in <strong>data analytics, AI, fintech, and tech consulting</strong>.
            In this website, I share insights about my academic journey, research, and projects.
            Feel free to learn more about my work! I am very passionate in combining different things I am interested in
            such as the intersection of business and computer science. My dream is to use financial technology and AI creativity to help
            people achieve their goals and to make the world a better place overall. I am also very passionate about music.
            I want to utilize my music skills and talent and use my academic knowledge in CS & Business to succeed. Music technology is also something
            I would be interested to focus on in the future. I am a very hard worker and commited to becoming a better person everyday.
            I have always had the belief that hard work beats talent on any given situation. If I could describe myself in a few words I would describe myself as:
            caring, hard working, dedicated, understanding, aware, loving, kind, loyal, trustworthy, and fair. My journey as a university students has been nothing but amazing!
            I have met many interested people, worked at an amazing company for my first co-op (IT Associate at Charles River Development) and have exceeded my expectations when it comes 
            to my academic performance and willingness to learn and adjust.
