        <p>
            I am passionate about data analytics, machine learning, and tech consulting.
            I love working with people in a group setting and bringing out the best of them.
            In my free time, I enjoy playing <strong>music</strong>, <strong>basketball</strong>, 
            and <strong>tennis</strong>. Even though I have a strong set of skills and experiences,
            there are times when I struggle in deciding what i want to do after I graduate. If you also 
            don't know who you want to be when you grow up, this website is for you! In the ordered list below
            , you can clearly see that my interests are so diverse, which makes it very hard to decide my future adventures!
            Even though it is scary, not knowing what to do after graduation is not a curse; but a gift.
            I am thankful to be open to doing so many different things combined or at once. I can be an artist, a developer,
            an analyst, a consultant, a teacher, an engineer, or a technician! My advice to people that struggle 
            with deciding what industry to focus on would be to embrace all the interests, ideas, experiences and skills 
            and creating something new, combining all of those things to maximize your happinness and work ethic!
